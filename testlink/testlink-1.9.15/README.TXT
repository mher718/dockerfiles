================================================================================== 
Accessing TestLink Support
================================================================================== 

We provide free, best effort support.
We are happy to help, but as any other kind of organisation we have rules that we 
consider mandatory, in order to do a good work.
These rules/guidelines are the defacto standard in report reporting, that you can find
searching on Internet. (give a look to http://forum.testlink.org)

Please follow these rules/guidelines, in order to allow us to make effective use of a 
scarse resourse: our time.

If you are going to be a lazy reporter, do not be surprised if your request is going
to be ignored of closed without action.
If you are going to provide fuzzy requirements for a new feature, again do not be 
surprised if your request is going to be ignored of closed without action.

When communicating with TestLink Development Team, you are playing the customer role.
Please remember all the things you do not like when YOUR CUSTOMERS ask for help
or new features, and AVOID to behave in the same way. :).

Buying TestLink Support
================================================================================== 

TestLink is a complicated piece of software, and has always been released 
under an Open Source license, and this will continue into the far future.

It has cost thousands of hours to develop, test and support TestLink. 
If you find TestLink valuable, we would appreciate if you would consider 
buying a support agreement.

Disclaimer: 
There are no SLAs on the support agreements. 
You're buying the privilege of having your questions looked at first in order of support level. 
You're doing this, because you find TestLink a valuable tool!
